# Video Generator
> By Jérémy Viallatte & Anne-Sophie Balestra

## Motivation 

This project was created to generate, from a domain specific grammar, a video composed by random subsequences.
This project contains the grammar of the new language used to indicate which subsequences will compose the video.


## Technologies used

 For this project we chose to use Xtext with the goal to create a DSL language for the video generator.
 Ecore allowed us to create another meta-model used in the transformation of the grammar to the result.
 Xtend was used for the transformation
 Ffmpeg returns detailed information about the subsequences used in this project
 Flowplayer will play the video sequence in a web browser.
 
## Deployment

We chose to use github to deploy our project in the goal to share the most we can of the idea.
